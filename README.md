#### By Tim Firman

## Description

_This application is intended to operate a customer database for a hair salon.  The database will contain a list of stylists who work at the salon, and a list of client for each stylist.  Per the assignment instructions, each client will associate with exactly one stylist.  Lists of both stylists and clients will be maintained, and the user can add to either list.

* The database and interface will support adding a new stylist

* A stylist will be saved with a field for additional details, and may initially have no clients

* The database and interface will support a query for a list of all stylists
